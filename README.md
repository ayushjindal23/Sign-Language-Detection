***Introduction***

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign Languages facilitate communication using hand signs. The earliest usage of sign languages has been recorded to be 5000 BC. In the research published by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2010, around 3 out of every 1000 children in the United States of America are born with a detectable amount of hearing loss in one or both ears. This project is a humble effort to help practice Sign Language Alphabets using Deep Learning model based architecture.

***Problem Statement***

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A deep learning-based model capable of predicting the sign language alphabet from the user. 

***Approach***

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a part of data collection, I used the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist">Kaggle dataset<a> consisting of 27,455 training and 7172 test images. After training the model for 20 epochs, the accuracy of the model on the training dataset is 99.5% and on the test dataset is 96.8%.

A custom CNN architecture based model as shown below has been used for this task:
